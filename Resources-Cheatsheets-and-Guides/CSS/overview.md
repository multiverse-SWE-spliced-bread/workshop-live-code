### Basic Selectors
    Element
    Id
    Class
### Fundamental Concepts
Cascading - How CSS resolves conflicts

    1. The Source Order
        - last definition (all else being equal) will be taken
    2. The Specificity
        - the more specific rule will be taken  (for example - a rule for paragraphs and a rule for the id of a particular paragraph:  the id will be taken)
    3. Inheritance
        - HTML is a tree-structure (parent and children elements): certain properties are inheritable.  If I style my element with a font colour, decendants will inherit this property.  Not all properties are inheritable

### Properties
    1. Colours
        - preset names
        - hexadecimal 
        - RGB:  rgb(0,0,0)
    2. Background Colours
        - Same principles as colours
    3. Background Images
        - background-image: url()
        - other properties for these exist including "background-repeat" and "background-size".  Others to explore as well.
    4. Font Family
    5. Text Align
    6. Text Decoration


### Length Units
    1. Absolute Lengths
        - px
    2. Relative Lengths
        - em and rem

### Box Model
