// In this kata you need to check the provided array (x) for good ideas 'good' and bad ideas 'bad'. If there are one or two good ideas, return 'Publish!',
// if there are more than 2 return 'I smell a series!'. If there are no good ideas, as is often the case, return 'Fail!'.

//eg   ['good', 'good', 'good', 'bad', good]  would return the string 'I smell a series!' as there are more than 2 'good' values

let testArray = ['good', 'good', 'good', 'bad', good];
